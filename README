Well, looks like the company I was working for will not
release the work I did, so now that I am happily self-
employed again I get to start over.  That's good though.
I am going to focus on implementing a variety of relationships
in the one-to-many class, such as containers, unconstrained
multiple matches, constrained multiple matches, etc.  I get
to do it all over the "right way" this time.  By the way,
don't expect this version to work at all.  :-)
